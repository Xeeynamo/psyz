 *
 * This library provides functions for communication with the PocketStation
 * (PDA) peripheral. It supports application execution, memory access,
 * real-time clock operations, and various PDA-specific features.
 *
 * All McxXXX() functions (except McxStartCom, McxStopCom, McxSync) perform
 * process registration only. Use McxSync() to check for process completion
 * before accessing result buffers or calling another process registration
 * function.
 *
 * Port numbers:
 * - Port 1: 0x00-0x03 (direct connect and multitap A-D)
 * - Port 2: 0x10-0x13 (direct connect and multitap A-D)

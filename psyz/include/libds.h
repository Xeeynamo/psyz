/**
 * @file libds.h
 * @brief CD-ROM Extended Library
 *
 * This library provides high-level CD-ROM functions with a simpler interface
 * than libcd. It offers asynchronous streaming, automatic data transfer, and
 * built-in error handling.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Simplified command interface (DsRead, DsPlay, DsSeek)
 * - Automatic sector buffering and data streaming
 * - Ready callbacks for data arrival notification
 * - Command queue management (up to 32 commands)
 * - Disk type detection and system status monitoring
 * - Support for CD-DA, CD-XA, and data reading
 *
 * Note: Cannot be used together with libcd.

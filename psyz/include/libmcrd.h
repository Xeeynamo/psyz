/**
 * @file libmcrd.h
 * @brief Extended Memory Card Library
 *
 * This library provides high-level file access functions for PlayStation Memory
 * Cards. It offers a more convenient interface than the low-level libcard
 * functions, with support for asynchronous operations, file management, and
 * error handling.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - File creation, deletion, reading, and writing
 * - Asynchronous operations with callbacks
 * - Memory Card detection and status checking
 * - Formatting and directory access
 * - Support for both blocking and non-blocking operations
 *
 * Port numbers:
 * - Port A: 0x00 (direct connect)
 * - Port B: 0x10 (direct connect)
 * - Card number: normally 0 (supports multitap expansion)
